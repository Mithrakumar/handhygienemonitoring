The codes attached to this repository contains the codes to monitor hand hygiene and its compliance using CNN. 

Hand Hygiene Monitoring and Compliance System is an integrated system that helps patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) by reducing the spread of healthcare-associated infections(HCAIs) in hospitals. It can also be implemented in public areas to decrease the spread of COVID-19. The goal of the system is to check if the user follows the WHO hand hygiene guidelines while washing or sanitizing their hands. If the user doesn’t comply with the guidelines, he/she is asked to wash or sanitize again till they comply with it. We have developed a system that uses branches of AI which include Convolution Neural Network and Computer Vision. The system is designed not only to intimate the users if the guidelines aren’t followed, it also updates a database that helps the company/hospital to monitor the hygiene of its people. We designed the various components of our project separately namely Personal Authentication, Hand Detection, WHO Hand Hygiene Compliance and Germ Detection systems. After developing these components we integrated them together
